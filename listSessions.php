This page will chance drastically in what will be shown and what can be clicked on based on who is seeing it. We
will need to use sessions / cookies here and then we can tell if that have logged in, and what type of account they are.
admins should be able to see all, and edit if possible. judges should see all and select one to judge, and students (if they have a log in)
should only be able to see their own session details I assume.
